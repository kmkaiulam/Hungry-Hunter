# Hungry Hunter

## Summary
Hungry Hunter is there for you when you need good food nearby and now.

## Motivation
This is for you if you're like me and can't settle for:
 -  just anything with caffeine in it, 
 -  a sandwich composed of bread whose name only has 1 syllable,
 -  or a sushi roll made with old rice
