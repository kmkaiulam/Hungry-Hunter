MOTIVATION:
This is for you if you're like me and can't settle for:</br> 
 -  just anything with caffeine in it, </br>
 -  a sandwich composed of bread whose name only has 1 syllable,</br>
 -  or a sushi roll made with old rice

SUMMARY
</br>
Hungry Hunter is there for you when you need good food nearby and now.
